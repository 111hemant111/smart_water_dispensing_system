# Smart Water Dispensing System
This projects implements a smart water dispensing system based on RFID technology and IoT. 

## Components used
1. Arduino Mega 2560
2. Particle Photon
3. Water flow sensor
4. EM-18 RFID Reader
5. LCD Display
6. Solenoid valve
7. Buzzer
8. 125 KHz RFID cards
9. Miscellaneous components: Jumper wires, Breadboard, LEDs, Potentiometer, Power adapter.

## Scope for improvement
1. Addition of external EEPROM other than Arduino's memory to store users' data.
2. Extension of IoT for data visualization.
